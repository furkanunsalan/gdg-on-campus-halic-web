## Introduction

This repository contains a website template for Google Developer Groups (GDG) on campus. It provides a customizable framework for showcasing your GDG events, team members, and social media profiles.

## Requirements

This project is built using:
- Next.js (created with create-next-app)
- TypeScript
- shadcn/ui

## Usage

### Data Folder

Modify the files in the `src/data/` folder to customize your website content:

```
src/
└── data/
    ├── events.ts
    ├── socials.ts
    └── team.ts
```

#### events.ts

Contains an array of events with the following type definition:

```typescript
export interface Event {
  bannerImage: StaticImageData;
  images: StaticImageData[];
  title: string;
  slug: string;
  description: string;
  text: string;
  date: string;
  location: string;
}
```

#### team.ts

Contains an array of team members with the following type definition:

```typescript
export type Variant = 'green' | 'blue' | 'red' | 'yellow';
export interface TeamMember {
  avatar?: StaticImageData;
  name: string;
  surname: string;
  title: string;
  variant: Variant;
  linkedinUrl?: string;
  instagramUsername?: string;
}
```

#### socials.ts

Exports a constant named `socials` containing your social media profile URLs for GitHub, LinkedIn, and Instagram. Access them using:

```typescript
socials.instagram.url
socials.linkedin.url
socials.github.url
```

### Image Folder

Organize your images in the `src/images/` folder:

```
src/
└── images/
    ├── events/
    │   ├── event-1/
    │   │   ├── 1.jpeg
    │   │   ├── 2.jpeg
    │   │   └── ...
    │   ├── event-2/
    │   │   ├── 1.jpeg
    │   │   ├── 2.jpeg
    │   │   └── ...
    │   └── ...
    └── team/
        ├── member-1.jpeg
        ├── member-2.jpeg
        └── ...
```

- The `events` folder contains individual event folders with event images.
- The `team` folder contains images of your core team members.

**Note:** Currently, you need to manually import each image in `events.ts` and `team.ts`. This process will be improved in a future version to be more dynamic.

## Hosting

After forking this repository and customizing it to fit your needs, you can host the website on Vercel for easy deployment and management.
